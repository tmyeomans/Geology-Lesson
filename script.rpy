label question_5_answer:

    a "{cps=35}Yes! The answer is metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rock forms under pressure from overlying mass, which often forms the banded feature.{/cps}"

    a "{cps=35}Many methods are used to obtain and record data from inside the Earth,{/cps}"
    a "{cps=35}some of which are drilling, observing outcrop and mapping.{/cps}"

# Drilling

label drilling:

    a "{cps=35}To drill, the common method is using an equipment such as a drilling rig{/cps}"
    a "{cps=35}What a drilling rig does is it will make a hole into the ground and drill down the subsurface.{/cps}"
    a "{cps=35}Then, after reaching a desired depth, a rock sample is extracted within a protective case{/cps}"

    a "{cps=35}These rock samples are also referred to as cores that provides a physical evidence that geologists use to observe and record detailed properties within the subsurface.{/cps}"

# Outcrop

    a "{cps=35}Another method is by observing outcrops. Outcrops are defined as exposed bodies of rocks.{/cps}"
    a "{cps=35}This is when geologists go out on the field to observe and collect data from the outcrop.{/cps}"

    a "{cps=35}On the field, geologists uses field notebooks which serves like a journal where they record every detail they observe on site.{/cps}"
    a "{cps=35}Therefore, even after geologists have no access to the site, they can go back to their notes to recall what they saw.{/cps}"
    a "{cps=35}This is very important when geologists tries to put the pieces together to make sense of the data to be able to analyze effectively.{/cps}"
